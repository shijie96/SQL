# Introduction:
This repository showcases completed work using Microsoft SQL Server and will be regularly updated with new SQL tasks. It serves as a record of my SQL skill development, including establishing relationships between fact and dimension tables, data cleaning, retrieval operations, and more. Each project includes a concise overview of the tasks and skills involved, providing a clear insight into my SQL journey.
