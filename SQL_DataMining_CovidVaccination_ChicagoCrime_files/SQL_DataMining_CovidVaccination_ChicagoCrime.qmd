## Covid Vaccination Project
### Load neccesary libraries
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pyodbc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print(pyodbc.drivers())
```

### Define server, database, driver trusted_connection for local machine database connection below
```{python}
server = r"DESKTOP-FT8NVCI\SQLEXPRESS" # use 'r' to handle backlashes
database = "Portfolio" 
driver = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server" # check the driver version from above step
trusted_connection = "yes" # uses windows authentication
```

### Create a connection to Database
```{python}
conn = pyodbc.connect(f"DRIVER={driver};SERVER={server};DATABASE={database};Trusted_Connection={trusted_connection}")

```

## Data Mining on CovidVaccination
1. List the cases of total covid contraction and deaths ordered by date and countries alphabetically
```{python}
query_1 = "select location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, new_cases, population from Portfolio.dbo.CovidDeaths order by 1,2"

df = pd.read_sql(query_1, conn)

print(df)
```

2. List the total cases and total deaths, and calculate the percentage of deaths relative to the total COVID-19 cases in your country.
```{python, echo = false, message = false, cache = true}
query_2 = "select location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as Deathpercentage from Portfolio.dbo.CovidDeaths where location like '%china%' and total_cases is not null order by 1,2"

df_1 = pd.read_sql(query_2, conn)
df_1

plt.figure(figsize = (12,12))

plt.plot(df_1['date'], df_1['Deathpercentage'], color = 'red')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Percentage of Covid_19 Deaths')
plt.title('Covid19 Deaths Daily in China')
plt.grid(False)
plt.show()

```

3. The total Covid-19 contraction cases verse the total population
```{python}
query_3 = "select location, date, total_cases, population, (total_cases/population)*100 as contractionpercentage from Portfolio.dbo.CovidDeaths where location like '%china%' and total_cases is not null order by 2"
df_2 = pd.read_sql(query_3, conn)
df_2

plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))
plt.plot(df_2['date'], df_2['contractionpercentage'], label = 'Contraction Percentage', color = 'red')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.title('COVID-19 Total Cases and Contraction Percentage in China Over Time')
plt.show()
```

4. countries with highest Infection rate compared to population

```{python}

query_4 = "select location, max(cast(total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount from dbo.CovidDeaths where total_deaths is not null group by location order by TotalDeathCount desc "

df_3 = pd.read_sql(query_4, conn)
df_3

df_sorted = df_3.sort_values(by = 'TotalDeathCount', ascending= False).head(20)

plt.figure(figsize= (12,8))
plt.barh(df_sorted['location'], df_sorted['TotalDeathCount'], color = 'royalblue')
plt.xlabel('Total Death Count')
plt.ylabel('Location')
plt.title('Top 20 Location with Height COVID - 19 Deaths')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.show()

```

5. Find out the country with Highest death per population
```{python}
query_5 = "select location, max(cast(total_deaths as int)) as totalDeathCount from dbo.CovidDeaths where continent is null group by location order by totalDeathCount desc"

df_4 = pd.read_sql(query_5, conn)
df_4

plt.figure(figsize = (12,8))
plt.bar(df_4['location'], df_4['totalDeathCount'], color = 'navy')
plt.xlabel('Location')
plt.setp(plt.gca().get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.ylabel('Total Death Count')
plt.title('Top 11 regions around the world with the Highest death per population')
plt.show()

```

6. Find the continents with highest death count per population
```{python}
query_6 = "select continent, max(cast(total_deaths as int)) as totaldeathcount from dbo.CovidDeaths where continent is not null group by continent order by totaldeathcount desc"

df_5 = pd.read_sql(query_6, conn)
df_5

plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
plt.barh(df_5['continent'], df_5['totaldeathcount'], color = 'crimson')
plt.xlabel('Total Death Count')
plt.ylabel('continent')
plt.title('Top 5 continent with the highest COVID Death')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.show()
```

7. Calculate the percentage of new deaths relative to the total number of new cases for each continent

```{python}
query_6 = "select date, sum(new_cases) as totalnewcases, sum(new_deaths) as totalnewdeaths, (sum(new_cases)/sum(new_cases)*100) as percentage from dbo.CovidDeaths where continent is not null and new_cases is not null group by date order by 1"

df_6 = pd.read_sql(query_6, conn)
df_6
```

8. Calculate the percentage of vaccination related to the total population
```{python}
query_7 = "select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, SUM(convert(bigint, vac.new_vaccinations)) over (partition by dea.location order by dea.date) as Rollingpeoplevaccinated, (SUM(convert(bigint, vac.new_vaccinations)) over (partition by dea.location order by dea.date) / dea.population) as VaccinationRate from dbo.CovidDeaths dea join dbo.CovidVaccination vac on dea.location = vac.location and dea.date = vac.date where dea.continent is not null and vac.new_vaccinations is not null order by 2, 3"

df_7 = pd.read_sql(query_7, conn)
df_7
```

## Chicago Crime Project
1. Database, Server connection
```{python}
server = r"DESKTOP-FT8NVCI\SQLEXPRESS" # use 'r' to handle backlashes
database = "Chicago_crime_ and_weather" 
driver = "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server" # check the driver version from above step
